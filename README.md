# My Note-Taking Environment

This is my organized note-taking environment using Obsidian. The structure is as follows:

## Directory Structure
- `Vaults/` - Multiple Obsidian vaults for different topics/contexts
- `Templates/` - Reusable templates for different types of notes
- `Backups/` - Automatic and manual backups of vaults

## Getting Started
1. Launch Obsidian from your applications menu
2. Open an existing vault or create a new one in the `Vaults/` directory
3. Use templates in the `Templates/` directory to maintain consistency
4. Regularly backup your vaults to the `Backups/` directory

## Recommended Obsidian Plugins
After opening Obsidian, consider installing these helpful plugins:
- Daily Notes - Quickly access today's notes
- Calendar - Visualize your notes in a calendar format
- Templates - Use predefined templates for different note types
- Advanced Tables - Better table functionality
- Obsidian Git - Version control for your notes

Happy note-taking!
